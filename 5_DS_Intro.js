//5_Data Structures: Introduction
//Readability, Memoery - space complexity, Speed - time complexity
//1. How to Build One
//2. How to Use it ***

//Computer: variables store in CPU, RAM, Storage
//RAM: massive storage area with big shelfs with addresses - each holds 8 bits / numbers - each called a byte
//var a = 1, one block with 32 bits

// console.log(Math.pow(5, 1000)) return "Infinity"
//As number becomes too large to store in RAM, then we need to represent a number that we cannot store into something tangible
